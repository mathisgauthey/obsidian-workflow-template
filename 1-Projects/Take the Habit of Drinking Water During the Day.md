# Take the Habit of Drinking Water During the Day

→ We can see that we missed the 5 of august, but we checked it out on the 6 and it went back with a due date for the 6.
If you don't want the streak to keep on and want to resume on the new streak date, use `🔁 every day when done` instead of `🔁 every day`. More informations [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Recurring+Tasks#Repeating+a+Task+Based+on+the+Original+Due+Date+or+the+Completion+Date).
